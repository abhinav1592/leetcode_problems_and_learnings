	 Learnings:<br>
	 1. Read the inputs properly before coding up on paper/editor.\n
	 2. Check for variables which remain undefined ( n vs len(given_parameter)). \n
	 3. Check for usage of enumerate vs range in Python3.\n
	 4. Initialize array with 0 elements - len(you_want_to_initialize)*[0]\n
   5. Counting the number of elements greater or less than current element position is O(n^2)
	    and you can avoid extra space to maintain it.\n
	 6. Solution which is in the link uses extra-space and next time when you visit this
	    problem, try to solve with O(1) space.\n
